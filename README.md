# MUSIC-PLAYER-APLICATION
This is the android application which will be used to handle music such as play pause resume and download music through url of the music.
This is built using android studio with Java.

The features are:
It uses SQlite Database to store title of the music.
It can download the songs through provided url and retrieve their title and store it in SQLite Database .
If the music title is already present , this will display music already exist and didn't download again.So, that the storage is not wasted becaue of multiple files.
It also Validates the Url ,so that random sequence of url can be detected.

And I had also uploaded the apk version of this project. You can download and instll in your android device.
